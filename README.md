# INSERTION SORT
Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one element at a time. 
It takes each element from the unsorted part and inserts it into its correct position in the sorted part of the array. 
The algorithm iterates through the list, comparing each element with the already sorted portion and inserting it at the correct position.

In this Python code, the insertion sort function takes an array as input and sorts it using the insertion sort algorithm. 
The example usage at the end initializes an array, prints the original array, performs insertion sort, and then prints the sorted array.
